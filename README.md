# Incorrect Null Handling in Addition Function

This repository contains a JavaScript function that demonstrates an uncommon error in handling null values.  The function `foo` adds two numbers, but incorrectly returns `null` when either input is `null`. The correct behavior is to return `0` in such cases. 

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful null checking and handling in JavaScript to prevent unexpected behavior and maintain data integrity.
